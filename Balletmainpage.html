    <!--History of Ballet-->
    <div class="historycontent">
      <h2>The History of Ballet </h2> Ballet begun during the Renaissance around the year of 1500 in Italy. When the form of dance begun the dances would wear mask, and really over the top clothing. Ballet danced by Noblemen, and Noblewomen at weddings, and
      other lavish events. Catherine de Medici, wife of King Henry II funded Ballet at the French Court, which helped to make Ballet more popular. Then in 1661 a dance academy opened in Paris, and Ballet started to be performed on stage. The clothing
      restricted them from dancing, so their moves were very small. As time went on Ballet evolved becoming big in Russia, France, and Italy. The modern day clothing for dance started to change in the early part of the 1900&#8217s. Women would perform
      in bell like shirts that ended at their calf. Around this time pointing of the toes, also became a very popular part of a Ballet dance routine. Ballet didn&#8217t become big in the USA until the 1930&#8217s. Since then Ballet has continued to evolve,
      and become a popular art form all across the world. </div>
