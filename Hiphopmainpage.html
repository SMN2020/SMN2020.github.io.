      <h2>The History of Hip-Hop </h2> Hip Hop dancing emerged in the late 1960&#8217s to 1970&#8217s in the Bronx, New York. This kind of dancing happened on the streets by people who didn&#8217t professionally dance or people who didn&#8217t attend dance
      academies. DJ&#8217s would mix records that matched well with the break dancing of this time. Soon after, hip hop dancing spread from the east coast to the west coast. The West coast adopting hip hop dancing and making it their own. They created
      locking, popping, and krumping, which eventually was encompassed by the East Coast. As the 80&#8217s came near breakdancing began to fade and more expressive types of hip hop dancing became popular. Which was influenced by the rise of freestyle
      rap and the club scene. The two different hip hop styles eventually emerged, and people continue to add their own creativity into new dances. </div>
