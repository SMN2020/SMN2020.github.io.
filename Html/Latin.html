            <p>Place your feet hip width apart in the neutral position. Your feet should be flat on the floor. Step your left foot forward in front of you. This is count 1. Salsa dancing has 1-8 counts. Always follow along to salsa music by doing 8 steps
                at a time. Step back on your right foot for count 2. Do not raise your right foot. Simply transfer your weight back to your right foot. Return your left foot back to the neutral position for count 3. Stay still for count 4. Counts 4 and
                8 are considered a pause so you will never do a step on these counts. Step your right foot behind you for count 5. Stay light on your feet as you step backward. Transfer your weight to your left foot on count 6. Do not lift or raise your
                left foot as you do this. Bring your right foot back to the neutral position for count 7. Stay still for count 8. </p>

        <div class="box Bachata"> <i><h3> The Bachata</h3></i>
            <p>move your feet from the left to the right in 4-beat increments. Start by taking your first step to the left on beat 1, bringing your right foot to meet it on beat 2. Then, step to the left again on beat 3, lifting your right foot slightly
                on beat 4. Without stopping, repeat the same steps in the opposite direction, stepping to the right on beat 1. Move your hips and arms in a rolling motion to match the movement of your feet. </p>
