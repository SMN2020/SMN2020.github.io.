            <H3>The History of Latin</H3>
            Latin dance was created from Mexican, South American, Central American and Caribbean culture and was performed by the native people of Latin America. Due to the European colonization, latin dance has been greatly influenced by Europeans and by African
            slaves. The dances were very specific and organized. They also represented many events such as the sowing and harvesting movement. Modern latin dance was developed across many countries, some places are Cuba, Puerto Rico, Brazil and Spain.
            Some dances created from these places are the Bolero, the Cha Cha, Rumba, Mambo, Merengue, the Paso Doble and the Samba. All of these dances and more were altered and taken in by the United States and Europe.
